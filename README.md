# NewYorkTimesQuerySite - HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, AJAX, API's

This was my first assignment using the New York Times' Article Search API. A partner and I designed a quick interface, and used ajax to query data from the API. This basic site allows users to select a search term, minimum article limit, and a date range, which we used to inform the API query and populate the browswer window. We included only a few of the data points provided by this API, including Article Title, Author, Publish Date, and Snippet.

Try it out, and let me know what you think! https://mbrz-0101.github.io/NewYorkTimesQuerySite/
